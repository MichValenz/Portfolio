      <h1 id="about">About Me</h1>
      <p>
        An analytically driven leader with 10 years of experience in leadership,
        quality control, root cause analysis, error prevention, technical
        writing, and cross-departmental collaboration. My experiences as a
        stakeholder and as a user make me the perfect addition to any web
        development project. I grew up in the outskirts of a small town in west
        Texas with nothing to do and spotty wifi. I spent my time surfing the
        web and it quickly became my safe space. I know the importance of an
        efficient and engaging website.
